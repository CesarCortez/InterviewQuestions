### Cloud Computing
- Cloud computing is the **on-demand** delivery of compute power.
  - Cloud computing is the **on-demand** delivery of IT resources and applications via the Internet with **pay-as-you-go** pricing.
  - Cloud computing provides a simple way to access servers, storage, databases and a broad set of application services over the Internet.
- With cloud computing you get to <ins>benefit from massive economies of scale</ins>.
- With cloud computing you can <ins>increase your speed and agility</ins>.
- With cloud computing you can <ins>stop guessing capacity</ins>.
- With cloud computing you can <ins>go global in minutes</ins>.
- **Types of cloud computing:**
	- **Infrastructure as a Service** (IaaS): the most basic category of cloud computing services. With IaaS, you rent IT infrastructure—servers and virtual machines (VMs), storage, networks, operating systems—from a cloud provider on a pay-as-you-go basis.
	- **Platform as a Service** (PaaS): refers to cloud computing services that supply an on-demand environment for developing, testing, delivering, and managing software applications. PaaS is designed to make it easier for developers to quickly create web or mobile apps, without worrying about setting up or managing the underlying infrastructure of servers, storage, network, and databases needed for development.
	- **Software as a Service** (SaaS): Refers to end-user applications. With a SaaS offering you do not have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed; you only need to think about how you will use that particular piece software. A common example of a SaaS application is web-based email where you can send and receive email without having to manage feature additions to the email product or maintaining the servers and operating systems that the email program is running on.
- **Types of cloud implementation:**
	- **Public cloud** (AWS, Azure, GCP): A public cloud is one in which the services and infrastructure are provided off-site over the Internet. These clouds offer the greatest level of efficiency in shared resources; however, they are also more vulnerable than private clouds.
	- **Private cloud** : A private cloud hosting solution, also known as an internal or enterprise cloud, resides on company’s intranet or hosted data center where all of your data is protected behind a firewall. This can be a great option for companies who already have expensive data centers because they can use their current infrastructure. However, private clouds are not as scalable as public clouds.
	- **Hybrid cloud** : A hybrid cloud is a combination of public and private clouds. In a hybrid cloud, an organization provides and manages some resources in-house and has others provided externally. For example, an organization might use a public cloud service, such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) for archived data but continue to maintain in-house storage for operational customer data.

### AWS Introduction

- Web service: a collection of open protocols and standards used for exchanging data between applications or systems.
- it is not typically tied to any one operating system or programming language.
- AWS: a collection of remote computing services that together make up a cloud computing platform, offered over the Internet by Amazon.com.
- Offers flexible, reliable, scalable, easy-to-use and cost-effective solutions.

### CAF (Cloud Adoption Framework)
- The Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) provides guidance for adopting the cloud.
- The CAF is designed to help you build a comprehensive approach to cloud computing across your organization, and throughout your IT lifecycle.
- The CAF is divided into six areas of focus, called perspectives.
- The perspectives are:
	- **Business**: The business perspective focuses on the business outcomes that you want to achieve.
	- **People**: The people perspective focuses on the people who are involved in your cloud adoption journey.
	- **Governance**: The governance perspective focuses on the governance model that you will use to manage and measure your cloud adoption journey.
	- **Platform**: The platform perspective focuses on the platform that you will use to support your cloud adoption journey.
	- **Security**: The security perspective focuses on the security controls that you will use to protect your cloud adoption journey.
	- **Operations**: The operations perspective focuses on the operations that you will use to run your cloud adoption journey.

### Six advantages of Amzon Cloud (Benefits)
- **1. Trade capital expense for variable expense:** 
	- No upfront investment
	- Pay for what you use
	- Economies of scale
- **2.Benefit from massive economies of scale:**
	- Lower variable costs than you can get on your own, because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers are aggregated in the cloud.
- **3.Stop guessing about capacity:** 
	- Eliminate guessing on your infrastructure capacity needs. 
	- When you make a capacity decision prior to deploying an application, you often either end up sitting on expensive idle resources or dealing with limited capacity. 
	- You can access as much or as little as you need, and scale up and down as required with only a few minutes notice.
- **4.Increase speed and agility:**
	- In a cloud computing environment, new IT resources are only ever a click away, which means you reduce the time to make those resources available to your developers from weeks to just minutes. 
- **5.Stop spending money running and maintaining data centres:**
	- Focus on projects that differentiate your business, not the infrastructure. 
	- Cloud computing lets you focus on your own customers, rather than on the heavy lifting of racking, stacking and powering servers.
- **6.Go global in minutes:**
	- Easily deploy your application in multiple regions around the world with just a few clicks. 
	- This means you can provide a lower latency and better experience for your customers at minimal cost.
### Amazon S3
- **CRR** (Cross-region replication): enables automatic, asynchronous
copying of objects across buckets in different AWS Regions.
- You cannot reserve capacity.
- Bucket names rules:
	- Names must be unique across all of AWS
	- Names must be 3 to 63 characters in length
	- Names can only contain lowercase letters, numbers and hyphens.
	- Names cannot be formatted as an IP address.
- IAM policies can be written to grant access to Amazon S3 buckets.
- Amazon S3 storage tier:
	- **S3 Standard** -> 99.99% SLA -> for data that is accessed less frequently, but
	requires rapid access when needed
	- **S3 Standard-IA** -> 99.9% SLA -> offers the high durability, high throughput, and low 		latency of S3 Standard
	- **S3 One Zone-IA** -> 99% SLA ->  *the most cost-effective* Amazon S3 storage tier for 		data that is not often accessed but requires high durability. It stores data in a **single** AZ
	- **Glacier** -> No SLA
- **Multipart upload** can be used to speed up uploads to S3
- **S3 Copy** -> up to 5GB in size in a single atomic operation
- **S3 Intelligent-Tiering** is an appropriate Amazon S3 storage class for "data with unknown/changing access pattern" 
- **Data consistency** models available are:
	- Read after write consistency for PUTS of new objects
	- Eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (takes time to propagate)
- "**MFA delete**" adds a layer of additional security to prevent accidental deletion.
- Amazon S3 **objects** consist of:
	- Key
	- Value
	- Version ID
	- Metadata
- **Object lifecycle management** can be used with objects so that they are stored cost effectively throughout their lifecycle. Objects can be transitioned to another storage class or expired. It enables you to **set rules** to **automatically transfer** objects between different storage classes at defined time intervals.
- **Standard-IA** and **One Zone-IA** both have a minimum storage duration charge of **30** days

### Amazon EBS volumes types
- **General purpose(gp2)**(SSD): provides a good balance of price to performance, is suitable for most workloads and can be used as a system boot volume.
- **Provisioned IOPS(io1)**(SSD): is a high-performance volume type that is more expensive and should be used for apps that require the higher performance.
- **Cold HDD(sc1)**:  cannot be used as a boot volume and is good for throughput oriented storage for infrequently accessed data.
- **Throughput Optimized(st1)**: It is ideal for streaming workloads with fast throughput such as big data and data warehouses.

### Amazon load balancers
- NLBs process traffic at the TCP level (layer 4)
- ALBs process traffic at the HTTP, HTTPS level (layer 7)
- CLBs process traffic at the TCP, SSL, HTTP and HTTPS levels (layer 4 & 7).
- *Load balancing with session affinity* can be used for **horizontal scaling** of **stateful** components.

### AWS Security Groups
- Only `allow` rules, You cannot create `deny` rules.
- A security group is **stateful** but this is not a rule type
- You can create **inbound** and **outbound** rules in a security group

### AWS Internet Gateway
- Do not have **allow/deny** rules
- It attached at the **VPC level**

### AWS Scalability
