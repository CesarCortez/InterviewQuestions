# Creational Design Patterns

Creational design patterns are concerned with the way of creating objects. These design patterns are used when a decision must be made at the time of instantiation of a class (i.e. creating an object of a class).

## Singleton Pattern

Consists of an object that cant be copied or modified. 

Let's say for example we want to have all of our app's configuration in a single object. And we want to disallow any duplication or modification of that object.


### Example: Using object literal
~~~js
const Config = {
  start: () => console.log('App has started'),
  update: () => console.log('App has updated'),
}

// We freeze the object to prevent new properties being added and existing properties being modified or removed
Object.freeze(Config)

Config.start() // "App has started"
Config.update() // "App has updated"

Config.name = "Robert" // We try to add a new key
console.log(Config) // And verify it doesn't work: { start: [Function: start], update: [Function: update] }

~~~

### Example: Using a class

~~~js

class Config {
    constructor() {}
    start(){ console.log('App has started') }  
    update(){ console.log('App has updated') }
}
  
const instance = new Config()
Object.freeze(instance)

## Factory Method Pattern

The Factory method pattern provides an interface for creating objects that can be modified after creation. The cool thing about this is that the logic for creating our objects is centralized in a single place, simplifying and better organizing our code.

### Example: Using a class

~~~js

class Alien {
    constructor (name, phrase) {
        this.name = name
        this.phrase = phrase
        this.species = "alien"
    }
    fly = () => console.log("Zzzzzziiiiiinnnnnggggg!!")
    sayPhrase = () => console.log(this.phrase)
}

const alien1 = new Alien("Ali", "I'm Ali the alien!")
console.log(alien1.name) // output: "Ali"

~~~

### Example: Using a factory method

~~~js

function Alien(name, phrase) {
    this.name = name
    this.phrase = phrase
    this.species = "alien"
}

Alien.prototype.fly = () => console.log("Zzzzzziiiiiinnnnnggggg!!")
Alien.prototype.sayPhrase = () => console.log(this.phrase)

const alien1 = new Alien("Ali", "I'm Ali the alien!")

console.log(alien1.name) // output "Ali"
console.log(alien1.phrase) // output "I'm Ali the alien!"
alien1.fly() // output "Zzzzzziiiiiinnnnnggggg"

~~~

## Abstract Factory Pattern

The Abstract Factory pattern allows us to produce families of related objects without specifying concrete classes. It's useful in situations where we need to create objects that share only some properties and methods.

That abstract factory calls the corresponding concrete factory given the corresponding logic. And that concrete factory is the one that returns the end object.

So let's see this with an example. Let's say we're modeling a system for a car company, which builds cars of course, but also motorcycles and trucks.

### Example: Using a class

~~~js

// We have a class or "concrete factory" for each vehicle type
class Car {
    constructor () {
        this.name = "Car"
        this.wheels = 4
    }
    turnOn = () => console.log("ChacabÃºm!!")
}

class Truck {
    constructor () {
        this.name = "Truck"
        this.wheels = 8
    }
    turnOn = () => console.log("RRRRRRRRUUUUUUUUUMMMMMMMMMM!!")
}

class Motorcycle {
    constructor () {
        this.name = "Motorcycle"
        this.wheels = 2
    }
    turnOn = () => console.log("sssssssssssssssssssssssssssssshhhhhhhhhhham!!")
}

// And and abstract factory that works as a single point of interaction for our clients
// Given the type parameter it receives, it will call the corresponding concrete factory
const vehicleFactory = {
    createVehicle: function (type) {
        switch (type) {
            case "car":
                return new Car()
            case "truck":
                return new Truck()
            case "motorcycle":
                return new Motorcycle()
            default:
                return null
        }
    }
}

const car = vehicleFactory.createVehicle("car") // Car { turnOn: [Function: turnOn], name: 'Car', wheels: 4 }
const truck = vehicleFactory.createVehicle("truck") // Truck { turnOn: [Function: turnOn], name: 'Truck', wheels: 8 }
const motorcycle = vehicleFactory.createVehicle("motorcycle") // Motorcycle { turnOn: [Function: turnOn], name: 'Motorcycle', wheels: 2 }

## Builder Pattern (Related to object composition)

The Builder pattern is used to create objects in "steps". Normally we will have functions or methods that add certain properties or methods to our object.

If we had a class or a factory function, the object we instantiate will always have all the properties and methods declared in that class/factory. But using the builder pattern, we can create an object and apply to it only the "steps" we need, which is a more flexible approach.

### Note: Object composition
Object composition is a way of combining objects or data types into more complex ones. It's a way of building objects by combining simpler objects.

### Example

~~~js

// We declare our objects
const bug1 = {
    name: "Buggy McFly",
    phrase: "Your debugger doesn't work with me!"
}

const bug2 = {
    name: "Martiniano Buggland",
    phrase: "Can't touch this! Na na na na..."
}

// These functions take an object as parameter and add a method to them
const addFlyingAbility = obj => {
    obj.fly = () => console.log(`Now ${obj.name} can fly!`)
}

const addSpeechAbility = obj => {
    obj.saySmthg = () => console.log(`${obj.name} walks the walk and talks the talk!`)
}

// Finally we call the builder functions passing the objects as parameters
addFlyingAbility(bug1)
bug1.fly() // output: "Now Buggy McFly can fly!"

addSpeechAbility(bug2)
bug2.saySmthg() // output: "Martiniano Buggland walks the walk and talks the talk!"

~~~

## Prototype Pattern

The Prototype pattern allows you to create an object using another object as a blueprint, inheriting its properties and methods.

The end result is very similar to what we get by using classes, but with a little more flexibility since properties and methods can be shared between objects without depending on the same class.

### Note: Prototypes and Inheritance in JS

In JavaScript all objects are descendants or instances of Object.prototype
everything in JavaScript is built upon the Object.prototype

https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/prototypes-and-inheritance-in-javascript/

### Example

~~~js
// We declare our prototype object with two methods
const enemy = {
    attack: () => console.log("Pim Pam Pum!"),
    flyAway: () => console.log("Flyyyy like an eagle!")
}

// We declare another object that will inherit from our prototype
const bug1 = {
    name: "Buggy McFly",
    phrase: "Your debugger doesn't work with me!"
}

// With setPrototypeOf we set the prototype of our object
Object.setPrototypeOf(bug1, enemy)

// With getPrototypeOf we read the prototype and confirm the previous has worked
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(bug1)) // { attack: [Function: attack], flyAway: [Function: flyAway] }

console.log(bug1.phrase) // Your debugger doesn't work with me!
console.log(bug1.attack()) // Pim Pam Pum!
console.log(bug1.flyAway()) // Flyyyy like an eagle!
