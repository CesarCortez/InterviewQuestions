## Structural Design Patterns

Structural patterns refer to how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures.

## Adapter Pattern

The Adapter allows two objects with incompatible interfaces to interact with each other.

Let's say, for example, that your application consults an API that returns XML and sends that information to another API to process that information. But the processing API expects JSON. You can't send the information as it's received since both interfaces are incompatible. You need to adapt it first.

### Example:

~~~js

// Our array of cities
const citiesHabitantsInMillions = [
    { city: "London", habitants: 8.9 },
    { city: "Rome", habitants: 2.8 },
    { city: "New york", habitants: 8.8 },
    { city: "Paris", habitants: 2.1 },
] 

// The new city we want to add
const BuenosAires = {
    city: "Buenos Aires",
    habitants: 3100000
}

// Our adapter function takes our city and converts the habitants property to the same format all the other cities have
const toMillionsAdapter = city => { city.habitants = parseFloat((city.habitants/1000000).toFixed(1)) }

toMillionsAdapter(BuenosAires)

// We add the new city to the array
citiesHabitantsInMillions.push(BuenosAires)

// And this function returns the largest habitants number
const MostHabitantsInMillions = () => {
    return Math.max(...citiesHabitantsInMillions.map(city => city.habitants))
}

console.log(MostHabitantsInMillions()) // 8.9

~~~

## Decorator Pattern

The Decorator pattern lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing them inside wrapper objects that contain the behaviors. If you're somewhat familiar with React and higher order components (HOC) this kind of approach probably rings a bell for you.

### Example:

~~~js
var User = function (name) {
    this.name = name;

    this.say = function () {
        console.log("User: " + this.name);
    };
}

var DecoratedUser = function (user, street, city) {
    this.user = user;
    this.name = user.name;  // ensures interface stays the same
    this.street = street;
    this.city = city;

    this.say = function () {
        console.log("Decorated User: " + this.name + ", " +
            this.street + ", " + this.city);
    };
}

function run() {

    var user = new User("Kelly");
    user.say();// User: Kelly

    var decorated = new DecoratedUser(user, "Broadway", "New York");
    decorated.say();// Decorated User: Kelly, Broadway, New York
}
~~~

## Facade Pattern

The Facade pattern provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.
A simple example could be JavaScript's map, sort, reduce and filter functions, which all work like good 'ol for loops beneath the hood.


### Example: https://wanago.io/2019/12/09/javascript-design-patterns-facade-react-hooks/
Let’s say we have a set of classes and methods that we want to use.
~~~js

class Bed {
  makeTheBed() {
    console.log('The bed is ready');
  }
}
 
class AirFreshener {
  spray() {
    console.log('A nice smell spreads through the air')
  }
}
 
class TrashCan {
  takeOutTrash() {
    console.log('The trash is taken out')
  }
}
 
class Dishwasher {
  fill() {
    console.log('The dishwasher is filled');
  }
  wash() {
    console.log('The dishwasher is working');
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
      resolve();
    });
  }
  empty() {
    console.log('The dishwasher is empty');
  }
}
~~~
We often might find ourselves wanting to execute the above methods in a particular order. Doing so multiple times across our codebase would violate the Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle. To avoid the above, we can create a Facade class. It can keep track of the dependencies and execute our methods in a particular order.
~~~js

class HouseCleaningFacade {
  constructor(bed, trashCan, airFreshener, dishwasher) {
    this.bed = bed;
    this.trashCan = trashCan;
    this.airFreshener = airFreshener;
    this.dishwasher = dishwasher;
  }
 
  cleanTheHouse() {
    this.bed.makeTheBed();
    this.trashCan.takeOutTrash();
    this.airFreshener.spray();
 
    this.dishwasher.fill();
    this.dishwasher.wash()
      .then(this.dishwasher.empty)
  }
}
~~~
Now we have a simple way to use a more complex set of actions with a lot of different parts. We can use it in a straightforward way and keep our application more readable.
~~~js

const houseCleaning = new HouseCleaningFacade(
  new Bed(),
  new TrashCan(),
  new AirFreshener(),
  new Dishwasher()
);
 
houseCleaning.cleanTheHouse();

~~~

## Proxy Pattern

The Proxy pattern provides a substitute or placeholder for another object. The idea is to control access to the original object, performing some kind of action before or after the request gets to the actual original object.

### Example:
Here I have a function that validates an authentication token. Don't pay much attention to how it does that. Just know that it receives the token as parameter, and once it's done it calls the next() function.
~~~js

const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken')

module.exports = function authenticateToken(req, res, next) {
    const authHeader = req.headers['authorization']
    const token = authHeader && authHeader.split(' ')[1]
  
    if (token === null) return res.status(401).send(JSON.stringify('No access token provided'))
  
    jwt.verify(token, process.env.TOKEN_SECRET, (err, user) => {
      if (err) return res.status(403).send(JSON.stringify('Wrong token provided'))
      req.user = user
      next()
    })
}

~~~
This function is a middleware, and we can use it in any endpoint of our API in the following way. We just place the middleware after the endpoint address and before declaration of the endpoint function:
~~~js

router.get('/:jobRecordId', authenticateToken, async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const job = await JobRecord.findOne({_id: req.params.jobRecordId})
    res.status(200).send(job)

  } catch (err) {
    res.status(500).json(err)
  }
})

~~~

In this way, if no token or a wrong token is provided, the middleware will return the corresponding error response. If a valid token is provided, the middleware will call the next() function and the endpoint function will get executed next.
